ðŸ“˜ DelayQueue - Java Concurrency
===========================
ðŸ”¹ **What is DelayQueue?**
---------------------------
- A **thread-safe** queue that holds elements that are delayed for a certain period before they can be accessed.
- It implements `Delayed` interface and is useful for scheduling tasks or processing elements after a specific delay.

ðŸ”§ **Common Methods Used in DelayQueue:**
-----------------------------------------
1. **`put(E e)`**:
   - **Purpose**: Adds an element to the queue.
   - **Blocking Behavior**: If the queue is full, the thread will block until space becomes available (this is relevant for bounded queues).

2. **`take()`**:
   - **Purpose**: Retrieves and removes the head of the queue.
   - **Blocking Behavior**: The thread will block until an item with sufficient delay has expired and becomes available.

3. **`peek()`**:
   - **Purpose**: Retrieves but does not remove the head of the queue.
   - **Blocking Behavior**: Returns `null` if the queue is empty or if no item is available.

4. **`getDelay(TimeUnit unit)`**:
   - **Purpose**: Returns the remaining delay for the item, which tells you when it can be processed.

5. **`compareTo(Delayed other)`**:
   - **Purpose**: Compares delay times of two `Delayed` objects to determine their order in the queue.

ðŸ”„ **Thread Safety:**
---------------------
- **DelayQueue** is thread-safe and ensures safe interaction between multiple threads that may be putting and taking delayed items.

ðŸ§© **Use Cases:**
-----------------
- **Task Scheduling**: Can be used to schedule tasks to execute after a delay (similar to `Timer` or `ScheduledExecutorService`).
- **Retry Mechanism**: Useful for retrying failed operations after a delay.
- **Event Handling**: Can be used in event-driven systems where actions are delayed based on some condition.

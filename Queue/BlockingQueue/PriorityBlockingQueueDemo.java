        //----------------------------------------------
        /*
        ðŸ”¹ **Priority Blocking Queue**:
        - PriorityBlockingQueue is a type of BlockingQueue that orders elements based on their natural ordering, or by a comparator provided at the time of construction.
        - Unlike ArrayBlockingQueue or LinkedBlockingQueue, the priority of elements is important, and the queue ensures that the element with the highest priority is always at the head.
        
        ðŸ”¹ **Custom Ordering**:
        - By default, the elements are ordered in natural order. But you can specify a custom comparator at the time of instantiation to define how elements are prioritized.
        
        ðŸ”¹ **Thread Safety**:
        - PriorityBlockingQueue is **thread-safe**, meaning that multiple threads can safely insert and remove elements without causing data inconsistency.

        ðŸ”¹ **Blocking Behavior**:
        - **`put(E e)`**: If the queue is full, this operation will block until space becomes available. 
        - **`take()`**: If the queue is empty, the thread will be blocked until an element becomes available.
        - **`offer(E e)`**: Adds an element to the queue if possible, returning `false` if the queue is full.
        - **`poll()`**: Retrieves and removes the highest-priority element, or `null` if the queue is empty.
        
        ðŸ”¹ **Capacity**:
        - There is no fixed capacity for `PriorityBlockingQueue`. It can grow dynamically as elements are added.
        - You can, however, set an upper bound (the queue can still grow beyond it).

        ðŸ”¹ **Use Cases**:
        - **Task Scheduling**: It is ideal for scheduling tasks where tasks with higher priority should be executed first.
        - **Producer-Consumer**: When multiple threads produce and consume elements, and you want to control the order based on priority.
        - **Real-Time Systems**: In systems where tasks need to be processed in priority order.

        ðŸ§  **Important Points**:
        ------------------------
        1. **Comparator**: You can define custom order by providing a comparator when constructing the queue. For example, to reverse the order, you could provide a comparator that reverses the natural order.
        
        2. **Thread Safety**: Like other `BlockingQueue` implementations, it is thread-safe, but the elements' retrieval order is controlled by their priority.

        3. **No Capacity Limit**: Unlike `ArrayBlockingQueue`, it has no capacity limitation, allowing dynamic growth.

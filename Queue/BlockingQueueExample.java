üìò BlockingQueue - Java Concurrency
====================================

üîπ What is BlockingQueue?
----------------------------
- BlockingQueue is an interface in the `java.util.concurrent` package.
- It represents a **thread-safe** queue that supports blocking operations.
- It allows threads to wait for a space to become available in a full queue, or wait for an element to become available in an empty queue.

üîß Common Implementations:
---------------------------
1. **ArrayBlockingQueue** ‚Äì A bounded queue backed by an array. Threads are blocked when trying to add elements to a full queue.
2. **LinkedBlockingQueue** ‚Äì An optionally bounded queue backed by a linked node structure.
3. **PriorityBlockingQueue** ‚Äì A queue with priority-based ordering of elements.
4. **DelayQueue** ‚Äì A queue where elements can be delayed before becoming eligible for processing.
5. **SynchronousQueue** ‚Äì A queue that doesn‚Äôt hold any elements but ensures that each put operation has a corresponding take operation.

üîÑ Common Methods of BlockingQueue:
------------------------------------
1. **`put(E e)`** - Inserts the element into the queue. If the queue is full, the thread is blocked until space is available.
    - Used when the producer is waiting to add items into the queue.

2. **`take()`** - Retrieves and removes the head of the queue. If the queue is empty, the thread is blocked until an element is available.
    - Used when the consumer is waiting to take items from the queue.

3. **`offer(E e)`** - Tries to insert the element into the queue. Returns `false` if the queue is full.
    - Non-blocking method; used when you want to attempt to insert without blocking.

4. **`poll()`** - Retrieves and removes the head of the queue. Returns `null` if the queue is empty.
    - Non-blocking method; useful when you don‚Äôt want the thread to wait if the queue is empty.

5. **`offer(E e, long timeout, TimeUnit unit)`** - Attempts to insert an element into the queue within a specified timeout period.
    - Used when you want to limit the wait time for adding an item to the queue.

6. **`poll(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)`** - Attempts to retrieve and remove the head of the queue within a specified timeout period.
    - Used when you want to limit the wait time for taking an item from the queue.

7. **`remainingCapacity()`** - Returns the number of additional elements that can be added to the queue without blocking.
    - Useful for checking how much space is available in a bounded queue.

üì¶ **Use Cases**:
---------------
- **Producer-Consumer Problem**: Multiple threads are producing and consuming items. A BlockingQueue efficiently synchronizes the producer and consumer threads.
- **Task Scheduling**: Tasks can be queued for execution by worker threads, and BlockingQueue helps ensure that the workers are blocked when there are no tasks to process.
- **Thread Pooling**: Used in thread pools to handle queued tasks waiting for execution.
- **Rate Limiting**: Limits the rate at which tasks are processed by controlling the size of the queue.

üß† **Thread Safety**:
----------------------
- **BlockingQueue** implementations are thread-safe. They ensure that one thread cannot modify the queue while another thread is reading or writing to it.
- Synchronization is handled internally, so developers don‚Äôt need to manually synchronize access.

‚öôÔ∏è **Internal Mechanism**:
---------------------------
- **Blocking Behavior**: If a thread tries to add an item to a full queue, it will be blocked until space becomes available. Similarly, if a thread tries to remove an item from an empty queue, it will be blocked until an item becomes available.
- **Non-blocking Operations**: Methods like `offer()` and `poll()` allow non-blocking behavior, where the operation either succeeds or fails immediately.
- **Time-out Options**: Methods like `offer(E e, long timeout, TimeUnit unit)` and `poll(long timeout, TimeUnit unit)` allow you to specify a time-out period.

üß© **Useful for**:
-------------------
- Managing task queues in concurrent applications.
- Synchronizing producer-consumer interactions in multithreaded environments.
- Implementing thread pools for managing worker threads.
- Rate limiting and controlling data flow between threads.

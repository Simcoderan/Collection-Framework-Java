üìò ConcurrentLinkedQueue - Java Concurrency
=========================================

üîπ **What is ConcurrentLinkedQueue?**
-------------------------------------
- A **non-blocking**, thread-safe queue implemented using a **lock-free** algorithm.
- Provides **high concurrency** and allows multiple threads to interact with the queue without blocking.
- Ideal for scenarios where you need high throughput and minimal contention between threads.

üîß **Common Methods in ConcurrentLinkedQueue:**
-----------------------------------------------
1. **`offer(E e)`**:
   - **Purpose**: Adds an element to the queue.
   - **Non-blocking**: Does not block the thread if the queue is full.
   - **Returns**: `true` if the element is added successfully.

2. **`poll()`**:
   - **Purpose**: Retrieves and removes the head of the queue.
   - **Non-blocking**: Returns `null` if the queue is empty.

3. **`peek()`**:
   - **Purpose**: Retrieves but does not remove the head of the queue.
   - **Non-blocking**: Returns `null` if the queue is empty.

4. **`isEmpty()`**:
   - **Purpose**: Checks if the queue is empty.
   - **Non-blocking**: Returns `true` if the queue is empty, `false` otherwise.

5. **`size()`**:
   - **Purpose**: Returns the number of elements in the queue.
   - **Non-blocking**.

üß† **Thread Safety and Performance:**
-------------------------------------
- **Non-blocking**: The queue operates without blocking threads, making it highly efficient in scenarios with frequent concurrent operations.
- **Lock-free**: Uses a lock-free algorithm, reducing contention and improving performance in highly concurrent environments.

‚öôÔ∏è **Use Cases:**
----------------
- **Producer-Consumer Problem**: Can be used where multiple producers and consumers interact with the queue concurrently.
- **Message Queues**: Ideal for situations that require fast message passing between threads or processes.
- **Event Queues**: Suitable for high-performance event handling in systems that require non-blocking operations.

üåê **Important Notes:**
----------------------
- **Thread-safe**: Ensures that all operations on the queue (like adding or removing elements) are done safely in multi-threaded environments.
- **Highly Concurrent**: Performs better than other queues that require locking, as it doesn't block threads during operations.

//Methods in Vector
 /*
 add(E e) â€“ Adds an element at the end of the vector.

add(int index, E element) â€“ Inserts an element at the specified index.

get(int index) â€“ Retrieves the element at the specified index.

set(int index, E element) â€“ Replaces the element at the specified index.

remove(Object o) â€“ Removes the first occurrence of the specified element.

remove(int index) â€“ Removes the element at the specified index.

size() â€“ Returns the number of elements in the vector.

isEmpty() â€“ Checks if the vector is empty.

contains(Object o) â€“ Checks if the vector contains the specified element.

clear() â€“ Removes all elements from the vector. */




/* ðŸš€Understanding Vector in JavaðŸš€

âœ” Legacy Class:
Vector is an older collection class that implements the List interface.
It was introduced in Java 1.0, before the ArrayList.


âœ” Dynamic Array:
Similar to ArrayList, Vector grows dynamically when elements are added.
Unlike arrays, which have a fixed size, Vector can expand as needed.


âœ” Thread Safety:
Vector is synchronized, meaning it is thread-safe.
However, this synchronization comes with a performance cost in single-threaded environments.

âœ” Performance Consideration:
In modern applications, ArrayList is preferred because it is faster than Vector in non-threaded environments.
If thread safety is required, CopyOnWriteArrayList (from java.util.concurrent) is a better alternative.

When to Use Vector?
âœ” If thread safety is a primary concern.
âœ” If working on legacy codebases where Vector is already in use.
âœ” When using synchronized collections in a multi-threaded environment */

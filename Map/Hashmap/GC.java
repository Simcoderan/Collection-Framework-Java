/*üîπ Key Differences

Garbage Collection	Not collected until null is assigned	                  Collected when JVM needs memory
Default in Java 	‚úÖ Yes	                                                ‚ùå No (requires WeakReference<T>)
Use Case	        Regular objects that must not be garbage collected	      Caching, memory-sensitive applications
*/

/*‚ùì When to Use Weak References?
- Caching Mechanisms: Weak references help cache objects that should be discarded when memory is needed.
- Preventing Memory Leaks: Used in scenarios where objects might accidentally be held in memory for too long.
- Storing Listeners or Handlers: Helps avoid unintentional retention of large objects.
*/

/*üîπ Key Points:
- By default, every object in Java is strongly referenced.
- The object is not garbage collected as long as a strong reference exists.
- Setting the reference to null makes the object eligible for garbage collection.
*/

class WeakReferenceExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {

        // Making the object eligible for GC
        strongPhone = null; 

        // Requesting garbage collection

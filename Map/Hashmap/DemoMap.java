/* ðŸš€ The concept of a Map in Java:

- A Map is an object that maps keys to values.

- It cannot contain duplicate keys.

- Each key maps to at most one value.

- It is similar to a dictionary, where a word (key) is used to find its definition (value). 

-  Map does not extends the Collection interface. */





/*Key Characteristics of the Map Interface

Key-Value Pairs â€“ Each entry in a Map consists of a key and a value.

Unique Keys â€“ No two entries can have the same key.

One Value per Key â€“ Each key maps to only one value.

Order in Different Implementations:

LinkedHashMap â€“ Maintains insertion order.

TreeMap â€“ Maintains natural (sorted) order.

HashMap â€“ Does not maintain any order. */
